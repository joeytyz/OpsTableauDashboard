Disclaimer: Due to confidential reasons, the data is blanked off on sensitive data for public viewing purposes without data leak
#
Environment: Microsoft Excel & Tableau
#
Purpose: Purpose of this dashboard was to track KPI within the team and external parties and was viewed on a weekly and monthly basis (On Time Shipments & On Time Requests)
#
The performance benchmark has been communicated with management to set as a baseline for passing/failing
#
1. Collection of data was done from 3 different external parties, of which different templates were received and have to be arranged into the correct columns in the Masterfile for analysis 


2.Cleaning of data which includes blank cells, formulas found within the sheet which was linked to external parties' own data sheet, and validating of information being provided
3. Loading of Excel files to Tableau
4. Creating relationship of different tabs of raw data for easy references & simple calculations to be done in Tableau - Outer Joins was implemented
5. Using Total On Time Shipments divided by Total Shipments gives us STS % - presented in percentage for easy and quick view
6. Using Total Requested Shipments Shipped On Time (with a certain allowance given by Management) divided by Total Shipments gives us STR % - presented in percentage for easy and quick view
7. Other KPI measurements like Commit To Build % (monthly), Delivery % (monthly), and Shipment Achieved % YTD were also done via bar graphs to let us view based on Product Family lines - this can be narrowed down when adding a filter on the side
8. Data visuals were created and color coordinations were done in accordance to company's color

This dashboard contains the same information as another repository on my profile - ExcelDashboard. This was created on Tableau for me to explore the basic functions of Tableau and am looking for more public data sets to work on for publications on my portfolio via Tableau Desktop (Public)
